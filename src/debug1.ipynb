Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the initial state is:\\n- Green block is clear.\\n- Hand is empty.\\n- Red block is on the table.\\n- Pink block is on top of the red block.\\n- Green block is on top of the pink block.\\n\\nSo, the stack from bottom to top is: Red → Pink → Green.\\n\\nThe goal is to have:\\n- Green block on the table.\\n- Red block on top of the green.\\n- Pink block on top of the red.\\n\\nSo, the desired stack from bottom to top is: Green → Red → Pink.\\n\\nAlright, so I need to move the blocks from the initial stack to this new configuration. Let me think about the possible actions I can take, considering the restrictions.\\n\\nThe actions allowed are:\\n1. Pick up a block.\\n2. Unstack a block from on top of another.\\n3. Put down a block.\\n4. Stack a block on top of another.\\n\\nRestrictions:\\n- Can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\\n- Can only do these actions if my hand is empty.\\n- Can only pick up a block if it's on the table and clear.\\n- A block is clear if it has no blocks on top and isn't being held.\\n- Can only unstack a block if it's on top of another and is clear.\\n- Once picked up or unstacked, I'm holding it.\\n- Can only put down a block I'm holding.\\n- Can only stack a block I'm holding onto another that's clear.\\n- After putting down or stacking, hand is empty.\\n- Once stacked, the lower block is no longer clear.\\n\\nLet me visualize the initial setup:\\n\\nTable:\\n- Red (on table)\\n  - Pink on Red\\n    - Green on Pink\\n\\nGoal:\\n- Green on table\\n  - Red on Green\\n    - Pink on Red\\n\\nSo, I need to get Green onto the table first, then Red on Green, then Pink on Red.\\n\\nBut in the initial state, Green is on top of Pink, which is on Red. So, to get Green onto the table, I need to unstack it from Pink. But to do that, I have to make sure that Green is clear, which it is because nothing is on top of it. However, I can only unstack a block if my hand is empty, which it is initially.\\n\\nWait, but to unstack Green from Pink, I need to have Pink as the lower block. But in the initial state, Pink is on Red, so Pink is not on the table. So, can I unstack Green from Pink? Let me check the restrictions.\\n\\nI can only unstack a block if it's on top of another and is clear. Green is clear because nothing is on top of it. So, yes, I can unstack Green from Pink.\\n\\nSo, first action: Unstack Green from Pink. Now, I'm holding Green.\\n\\nNext, I need to put Green down on the table. So, action: Put down Green. Now, Green is on the table, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nNow, the stack is:\\n- Red on table\\n  - Pink on Red\\n\\nGreen is on the table, clear.\\n\\nNext, I need to get Red onto Green. But Red is currently under Pink. So, I need to move Pink out of the way first.\\n\\nTo move Pink, I can unstack it from Red. But wait, Pink is on Red, and Red is on the table. So, can I unstack Pink from Red? Let me see.\\n\\nPink is on Red, and since nothing is on top of Pink (because Green was unstacked and put down), Pink is clear. So, yes, I can unstack Pink from Red.\\n\\nSo, action: Unstack Pink from Red. Now, I'm holding Pink.\\n\\nThen, I need to put Pink somewhere. But where? I can't stack it on Green yet because the goal is to have Red on Green, then Pink on Red. So, maybe I should put Pink on the table for now.\\n\\nAction: Put down Pink. Now, Pink is on the table, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nNow, the state is:\\n- Red on table\\n- Green on table\\n- Pink on table\\n\\nWait, no. Because when I unstacked Pink from Red, Red is still on the table, and Pink was put down on the table. So, now both Red and Pink are on the table, and Green is also on the table. So, all blocks are on the table, but I need to stack them in the order Green → Red → Pink.\\n\\nSo, next, I need to stack Red on Green. To do that, I need to pick up Red.\\n\\nAction: Pick up Red. Now, I'm holding Red.\\n\\nThen, stack Red on Green. But wait, Green is on the table and is clear because nothing is on top of it. So, I can stack Red on Green.\\n\\nAction: Stack Red on Green. Now, Red is on Green, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nNow, the state is:\\n- Green on table\\n  - Red on Green\\n\\nPink is on the table, clear.\\n\\nNext, I need to stack Pink on Red. So, I need to pick up Pink.\\n\\nAction: Pick up Pink. Now, I'm holding Pink.\\n\\nThen, stack Pink on Red. Red is on Green, and since Pink is clear (nothing on top of it), I can stack it on Red.\\n\\nAction: Stack Pink on Red.

The pink block is clear, the red block is clear, and the green block is on the table with the pink block on top of it. The red block is also on the table. So, the initial configuration is:\\n\\n- Table: green (on table), red (on table)\\n- On top: pink is on green.\\n\\nMy goal is to have red on the table, pink on top of red, and green on top of pink. So the final stack should be red at the bottom, then pink, then green on top.\\n\\nI need to figure out the sequence of actions to achieve this. Let me list the possible actions again to make sure I understand them:\\n\\n1. Pick up a block: Can only pick up a block if it's on the table and clear (nothing on top of it).\\n2. Unstack a block: Can only unstack a block if it's on top of another and is clear.\\n3. Put down a block: Can only put down a block I'm holding.\\n4. Stack a block: Can only stack a block I'm holding onto another block that's clear.\\n\\nAlso, I can only do one action at a time, and my hand can only hold one block. So, each action must be done step by step.\\n\\nLet me visualize the initial state:\\n\\n- Table: green, red\\n- On green: pink\\n\\nSo, green is under pink, and red is separate on the table.\\n\\nI need to get red on the table, then pink on red, then green on pink. Wait, but green is currently under pink. So, I need to move green on top of pink, which is on top of red.\\n\\nWait, no, the goal is red on table, pink on red, green on pink. So, the stack from bottom to top is red, pink, green.\\n\\nBut currently, green is on the table with pink on top, and red is on the table. So, I need to move pink and green onto red.\\n\\nLet me think about the steps.\\n\\nFirst, I need to get red as the base. So, perhaps I can stack pink on red, then green on pink.\\n\\nBut to do that, I need to have pink and green available to stack. However, currently, pink is on top of green, which is on the table. So, I can't directly pick up pink because it's on top of green, but green is on the table. Wait, no, pink is on green, so green is not clear because it has pink on top. So, I can't pick up green yet because it's not clear.\\n\\nSo, first, I need to unstack pink from green. To do that, I can unstack pink because it's on top of green and is clear (since nothing is on top of pink). So, I can unstack pink from green.\\n\\nLet me try that.\\n\\nAction 1: Unstack pink from green. Now, pink is in my hand, and green is on the table, clear.\\n\\nNow, the state is:\\n\\n- Hand: holding pink\\n- Table: green, red\\n- On green: nothing (since pink was unstacked)\\n- On red: nothing\\n\\nNow, I need to put down pink somewhere. But I want to stack it on red. So, I can stack pink on red because red is clear (nothing on top of it).\\n\\nAction 2: Stack pink on red. Now, pink is on red, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nState:\\n\\n- Hand: empty\\n- Table: green, red\\n- On red: pink\\n- On green: nothing\\n\\nNow, I need to get green on top of pink. But green is on the table and is clear (since pink was unstacked earlier). So, I can pick up green.\\n\\nAction 3: Pick up green. Now, I'm holding green.\\n\\nState:\\n\\n- Hand: holding green\\n- Table: red\\n- On red: pink\\n- On green: nothing (since I picked it up)\\n\\nNow, I need to stack green on pink. But pink is on red, and pink is clear because nothing is on top of it. So, I can stack green on pink.\\n\\nAction 4: Stack green on pink. Now, green is on pink, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nFinal state:\\n\\n- Table: red\\n- On red: pink\\n- On pink: green\\n\\nWhich is the desired configuration.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\n1. Unstack pink from green: Possible because pink is clear and on top of green.\\n\\n2. Stack pink on red: Red is clear, so yes.\\n\\n3. Pick up green: Green is on the table and clear, so yes.\\n\\n4. Stack green on pink: Pink is on red and is clear, so yes.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So the plan is:\\n\\n1. Unstack pink from green.\\n\\n2. Stack pink on red.\\n\\n3. Pick up green.\\n\\n4.

However, Green is on the table and clear (since Pink was removed), so I can pick it up.\\n\\nAction 3: Pick up Green.\\n\\nNow, hand is holding Green. The table has Red and Pink.\\n\\nNext, I need to stack Green onto Red. To stack, the target block (Red) must be clear. Red is on the table and clear because nothing is on top of it.\\n\\nAction 4: Stack Green onto Red.\\n\\nNow, the state is:\\n- Table: Red with Green on top, Pink.\\n- Hand: Empty.\\n\\nBut wait, the goal is to have Pink on the table, which it is, and Green on Red. So, that seems to be achieved. However, let me double-check the steps to ensure I didn't miss anything.\\n\\nWait, in the initial state, Pink was on Green. I unstacked Pink, put it down, picked up Green, and stacked it on Red. That should work.\\n\\nBut let me think again. After unstacking Pink, I put it down, so Pink is on the table. Then I pick up Green and stack it on Red. So yes, that should be correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, could I have done it differently? For example, after unstacking Pink, could I have stacked Pink on Red first? Let me see.\\n\\nIf I unstack Pink, then instead of putting it down, could I stack it on Red? But Red is clear, so yes. Then I would have Pink on Red, and Green on the table. Then I could pick up Green and stack it on Red, but wait, Red now has Pink on it, so it's not clear. So I can't stack Green on Red anymore because Pink is on Red. So that approach wouldn't work because after stacking Pink on Red, Red is no longer clear, so I can't stack Green on it.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first get Pink out of the way, then move Green onto Red.\\n\\nSo, the plan is:\\n\\n1. Unstack Pink from Green.\\n2. Put down Pink.\\n3. Pick up Green.\\n4. Stack Green on Red.\\n\\nThat should achieve the goal.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to rearrange these blocks according to the goal. Let me start by understanding the initial setup and the goal.\\n\\nInitially, I have three blocks: pink, green, and red. The pink and green blocks are clear, meaning nothing is on top of them. The red block is on the table, and the green block is on top of the red block. So the current stack is red at the bottom, green on top of red, and pink is separate on the table.\\n\\nMy goal is to have green on the table, red on top of green, and pink on top of red. So the final stack should be green at the bottom, red in the middle, and pink on top.\\n\\nLet me list out the initial state:\\n\\n- On table: pink, red\\n- Green is on top of red.\\n\\nSo the stacks are:\\n- Stack 1: red (bottom), green (top)\\n- Stack 2: pink\\n\\nHand is empty.\\n\\nI need to move blocks using the allowed actions: pick up, unstack, put down, stack. But I have to follow the restrictions.\\n\\nFirst, I need to get green off of red so that I can place red on top of green. But to do that, I might need to move green somewhere else first.\\n\\nLet me think step by step.\\n\\n1. I need to unstack green from red. But to do that, I have to make sure that green is clear. Since green is on top of red, it is clear because nothing is on top of it. So I can unstack green.\\n\\nBut wait, the action is \"unstack a block from on top of another block.\" So I can unstack green from red. But I can only do that if my hand is empty, which it is.\\n\\nSo first action: Unstack green from red. Now, I\\'m holding green.\\n\\n2. Now, I need to put down green. I can put it on the table because the table is clear, and green is clear (since I\\'m holding it and nothing is on top of it). So I put green down on the table.\\n\\nNow, the state is:\\n\\n- On table: pink, green\\n- Red is on the table, but nothing is on top of it.\\n\\n3. Next, I need to get red on top of green. But red is currently on the table. To stack red on green, I need to pick up red.\\n\\nBut wait, can I pick up red? Red is on the table and is it clear? Yes, because nothing is on top of red now. So I can pick up red.\\n\\nSo action: Pick up red. Now I\\'m holding red.\\n\\n4. Now, I need to stack red on top of green. Green is on the table and is clear because nothing is on top of it. So I can stack red on green.\\n\\nAction: Stack red on green. Now, red is on top of green, and my hand is empty.\\n\\n5. Now, I need to get pink on top of red. Pink is on the table and is clear. So I can pick up pink.\\n\\nAction: Pick up pink. Now I\\'m holding pink.\\n\\n6. Finally, I need to stack pink on top of red. Red is currently on top of green, so red is not clear because pink is about to be stacked on it. Wait, no, after I stack pink on red, red will no longer be clear, but before stacking, red is clear because nothing is on top of it except that I\\'m about to place pink there.\\n\\nWait, no. When I stack pink on red, red is the block onto which I\\'m stacking. So red needs to be clear. Currently, red is on top of green, but nothing is on top of red. So red is clear.\\n\\nSo action: Stack pink on red. Now, pink is on top of red, and my hand is empty.\\n\\nLet me check the final state:\\n\\n- Green is on the table.\\n- Red is on top of green.\\n- Pink is on top of red.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s the goal.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I didn\\'t skip any steps or make any mistakes.\\n\\nLet me go through each action again:\\n\\n1. Unstack green from red. Hand holds green.\\n2. Put down green on table.\\n3. Pick up red.\\n4. Stack red on green.\\n5. Pick up pink.\\n6. Stack pink on red.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. Each action follows the rules because each time I\\'m only moving one block at a time, my hand is empty when I need to pick up or unstack, and I\\'m only stacking onto clear blocks.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the correct plan.',\n",

Also, I can only pick up a block if it's clear, meaning nothing is on top of it, and it's on the table.\\n\\nFirst, I need to get the pink block on top of the green one.

But green is on the table and clear, so I can pick it up. Wait, no, I need to stack pink on green, so I should pick up pink first. Let me see: pink is clear now, so I can pick it up. Once I pick up pink, I can stack it on top of green. But wait, green is on the table and clear, so stacking pink on green should be possible.\\n\\nWait, but after I unstack red and put it down, the state is: green on table, pink on table, red on table.

But right now, the teal is on top of brown, so I can't just pick up brown because it's not clear. I need to get rid of the teal first.\\n\\nSo, step one: unstack the teal block from the brown.

After action 1: pick up teal, so teal is in hand, table has brown and violet (violet on brown). After action 2: unstack violet from brown, so now I'm holding violet, and the table has brown. Then action 3: put down violet, so now the table has brown and violet, with violet on the table, not stacked on brown anymore. So the table has two separate blocks: brown and violet.\\n\\nSo now, I can pick up brown because it's on the table and clear (since nothing is on top of it). So action 4: pick up brown.\\n\\nNow, I'm holding brown, and the table has violet.\\n\\nNext, I need to stack brown on top of violet. To do that, I need to make sure that violet\",\n",
       " \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to rearrange these blocks according to the goal. Let me start by understanding the initial setup and the goal.\\n\\nInitially, the blocks are stacked as follows: green on top of red, which is on top of pink. So the order from bottom to top is pink, red, green. All of these are on the table. The hand is empty, and the green block is clear because nothing is on top of it.\\n\\nThe goal is to have green on the table, pink on top of green, and red also on the table. So the final arrangement should be green on the table with pink stacked on it, and red separate on the table.\\n\\nLet me list out the actions I can perform and the restrictions:\\n\\nActions:\\n1. Pick up a block\\n2. Unstack a block from on top of another\\n3. Put down a block\\n4. Stack a block on top of another\\n\\nRestrictions:\\n- Can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\\n- Can only do these actions if my hand is empty.\\n- Can only pick up a block if it's on the table and clear (nothing on top of it).\\n- Can only unstack a block if it's clear and actually on top of another.\\n- Once picked up or unstacked, I'm holding it.\\n- Can only put down or stack a block I'm holding.\\n- After putting down or stacking, hand is empty.\\n- When stacking, the block being stacked onto must be clear.\\n\\nAlright, so starting with the initial state:\\n\\n- Table: pink (bottom), red on pink, green on red.\\n- Hand: empty.\\n\\nI need to get green on the table, pink on green, and red on the table.\\n\\nFirst, I need to get green off of red. Since green is on top, I can pick it up because it's clear. Let me try that.\\n\\nAction 1: Pick up green. Now, hand holds green, and the stack is pink, red.\\n\\nBut wait, after picking up green, I can't do anything else until I put it down. So I need to put green somewhere. The goal is to have green on the table, so I can put it down there.\\n\\nAction 2: Put down green. Now, green is on the table, hand is empty. The stack is still pink, red.\\n\\nNext, I need to get red off of pink. Since red is on top of pink, I can pick it up because it's clear.\\n\\nAction 3: Pick up red. Hand holds red. Now, the stack is just pink on the table.\\n\\nI need to put red somewhere. The goal is to have red on the table, so I can put it down next to green.\\n\\nAction 4: Put down red. Now, red is on the table, hand is empty. The stack is pink on the table.\\n\\nNow, I have pink on the table, green on the table, and red on the table. But the goal is to have pink on top of green. So I need to stack pink onto green.\\n\\nBut wait, pink is currently on the table, and green is also on the table. To stack pink on green, I need to pick up pink and then stack it on green.\\n\\nAction 5: Pick up pink. Hand holds pink.\\n\\nNow, I need to stack pink on green. But green is on the table and clear because nothing is on top of it.\\n\\nAction 6: Stack pink on green. Now, pink is on top of green, and hand is empty.\\n\\nSo the final state is:\\n\\n- On table: green (with pink on top), red on table.\\n\\nWait, but the goal was to have green on the table, pink on green, and red on the table. So that's achieved.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything.\\n\\n1. Pick up green.\\n2. Put down green.\\n3. Pick up red.\\n4. Put down red.\\n5. Pick up pink.\\n6. Stack pink on green.\\n\\nYes, that seems to work. Each action is valid because each time I pick up, my hand is empty, and the block is clear. When stacking, the target block (green) is clear.\\n\\nI think that's the correct sequence.\"]"
